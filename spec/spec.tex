\chapter{Geometric Syntax}
\label{chap:syntax}

Construct proposes a new geometric method for creating programs. 
Most existing languages offer a textual syntax for composition, which offers an essentially linear approach to writing programs. 
A program in Construct is created by associating geometric objects and relationships in a 2d space. 
This allows the programmer to explore the design of a program in a more open manner, and facilitates the expression of programs which need not have a linear evaluation order. 

Furthermore, a geometric syntax provides a format that can easily express problems which have a geometric or visual interpretation. 
Points, lines, and circles are all primitive objects in Construct, and are presented to the programmer visually, harnessing the brain's highly evolved visual reasoning systems. 

While it is possible to perform symbolic computations in Construct, they are not the target problem set. 
Therefore, a programmer might find certain symbolic tasks, such as text manipulation, as roundabout in Construct as geometric tasks are in a textual syntax.

\section{The Programming Environment}
\label{sec:environ}

Because Construct does not use a textual syntax, programs cannot be composed in a text editor. 
Rather, they require an environment specifically suited to geometric programming. 
This section describes the fundamental characteristics of such an environment and presents a design for its interface.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{interface.pdf}
  \caption{An interface design for the programming environment (TODO: detail)}
  \label{fig:interface}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:interface} shows a general design for the interface, highlighting the five important regions:

\begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item Menu Bar \\
    The Menu Bar provides access to functionality which has no representation in the language of the program itself, such as loading or saving programs or starting a live interpreter.
  \item Tool Palettes \\
    Tool Palettes contain commands which create new elements that have meaning in the program. 
    The three main palettes provide commands for Instantiation (see Section \ref{sec:inst}), Definition (see Section \ref{sec:applydef}) and Modification (see Section \ref{sec:applymod}).
  \item Program Space \\
    The Program Space shows a data view of the Construct program. 
    It allows the the programmer to view directly how the program will behave, using representative examples for objects which are not precisely defined. 
    This programming-by-examples approach mimics the manner in which geometry is often taught and worked with, reducing the mental load on the programmer to imagine the meaning of the geometric relationships.
  \item Program Graph \\
    The Program Graph shows the dependency relationships between the objects in Construct. 
    Since all definitions flow from a group of predefined objects to an-as-yet-undefined object, the Program Graph produces a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
  \item User Content Drawers \\
    The User Content Drawers contain definitions which have been created by the programmer as abstractions.
    The programmer may use these definitions in a similar manner to using the built-in definitions.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Object Instantiation}
\label{sec:inst}

To begin working with any of the objects in Construct, the programmer must first {\it instantiate} them. 
One tool palette in the programming environment provides commands that instantiate new objects. 

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \fbox{
    \begin{minipage}{2in}\hfill\vspace{1.5in}\end{minipage}
  }
  \caption{A newly-instantiated point object}
  \label{fig:new-point}
\end{figure}

When first instantiated, a new Construct object is undefined. 
In the case of the point object in Figure \ref{fig:new-point}, this means that it could have any position in the 2d space of the program. 
A line object could have any position and any orientation.
A circle could have any center position and any radius. 
Distances and angles can have any size.

Also notice that the instantiation operation does not require the programmer to name the object. 
In a textual syntax, names are necessary in order for both the programmer and the parser to understand what objects are being used at any stage of the program.
In Construct, the programmer can simply {\it see} the difference between objects.
The system, similarly is free to reference objects directly, since the programming environment can provide an unambiguous description of which objects are being used.
Naming objects is supported in Construct, for the convenience of the programmer, but the names are simply discarded for the purposes of execution.

\section{Applying Definitions}
\label{sec:applydef}

In order for objects to have any meaning, the programmer applies definitions to them. 
These definitions establish relationships between the objects in a Construct program. 
Since definitions are relationships between objects, almost all of them require multiple objects to be instantiated in the program space. 
Section \ref{sec:def} lists the definitions which are built into Construct.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{definition.pdf}
  \caption{The interaction to apply a definition to an object}
  \label{fig:def-interaction}
\end{figure}

Applying a definition is an infix operation in the programming environment. 
First, the programmer selects the object which will be defined. 
Then, the programmer selects a definition from a tool palette in the programming environment. 
Finally, the programmer selects the objects which are referenced by the defintion.
Figure \ref{fig:def-interaction} shows how these interactions may appear in the programming environment, using the $\mathsf{on}$ definition as an example.

We can imagine a similar statement in a textual language:

\begin{verbatim}
    Point x = arbitrary_on_line(l);
\end{verbatim}

However, the effect at runtime of executing this part of the program is not as linear as the textual equivalent suggests.
In most cases, the object which is being defined will be updated to conform to the new definition's requirements, and other data (if not dependent on the object being defined) will not change.

However, in some cases, the new definition constrains the object in a way that is unsatisfiable. 
In these circumstances, the rest of the program will be recalculated in an attempt to satisfy the new definition. 
If this is successful, the programmer may see many objects in the program space rearrange. 
If it is unsuccessful, the programmer will be alerted that the definitions are unsatisfiable.
More information about errors is presented in Section \ref{sec:failure}.

\subsection{Implicit Definitions}
\label{subsec:implicit-def}

Some definitions which are represented explicitly in the internal representation are in fact implicitly applied in the programming environment.

One such definition is the $\mathsf{elem}$ definition used to extract objects from groups. 
In the geometric syntax, there is no need to explicitly break objects out of groups, because they are already visible to the programmer in the data view.

\section{Applying Modifications}
\label{sec:applymod}

\subsection{Object Modifications}
\label{subsec:mod-obj}

The process of applying object modifications (Section \ref{subsec:mods-obj}) is quite similar to that of applying definitions.
The programmer first selects the object to be modified, and then selects the modification from a tool palette.

\subsection{Definition Modifications}
\label{subsec:mod-def}

The interactions for definitions modifications vary by modification.
Each of them are outlined below:

\subsubsection{$\mathsf{not}$ Modification}

There are two circumstances when the $\mathsf{not}$ modification can be applied. 
If the programmer wishes to negate a definition which is currently being applied, then after selecting the definition from the appropriate tool palette, the programmer may select $\mathsf{not}$ from its tool palette.
When the definition application is made, it will be negated.

If the programmer wishes to negate a definition which has already been applied to an object, the process is similar to the application of object modifications.
The programmer first selects the definition, and then selects $\mathsf{not}$ from its tool palette.

\subsubsection{$\mathsf{handle}$ Modification}

$\mathsf{handle}$ requires an existing definition to be defined for the object $\rho$. 
The programmer selects this definition, then selects the $\mathsf{handle}$ modifier from its tool palette.
The programmer must then select another definition to serve as the ``failure'' case of the $\mathsf{handle}$. 
This definition is automatically applied to $\rho$. 
The programmer must specify reference objects for the definition as in normal definition application.

\subsubsection{$\mathsf{each}$ Modification}

The $\mathsf{each}$ modification must be specified during the initial definition application process.
First, the programmer selects the object to be defined as normal. 
This object must have type $\mathsf{set}(\tau)$.
Then the programmer activates the $\mathsf{each}$ command from a tool palette, and then selects some definition $\delta_\tau$ appropriate to an object of type $\tau$.
Finally, the reference object must be of type $\mathsf{set}(\tau')$, where $\tau'$ is the type of the reference object for $\delta_\tau$.

\subsubsection{$\mathsf{filter}$ Modification}

The interaction to apply a $\mathsf{filter}$ modification is identical to that of $\mathsf{each}.$

\section{Creating Local Definitions}
\label{sec:create-local}

Local definitions (see Section \ref{sec:local}) allow the programmer to wrap up complex derivations of objects into a single definition without making that internal logic available to other programs.
They are similar to anonymous functions in traditional text-based languages.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \fbox{
    \begin{minipage}{3in}\hfill\vspace{2in}\end{minipage}
  }\;
  \fbox{
    \begin{minipage}{3in}\hfill\vspace{2in}\end{minipage}
  }
  \caption{The appearance of a local definition in the program graph (left) and space (right)}
  \label{fig:local}
\end{figure}

Local definitions can be created from the beginning in a manner similar to the method of applying definitions.
The programmer selects the object to define, then selects the $\mathsf{local}$ tool palette command. 
Unlike a predefined definition, the local definition has no references already defined.

The program space and graph will then appear similar to what is shown in Figure \ref{fig:local}. 
The object which is to be defined will appear locally, marked as $\mathsf{final}$. 
The programmer may then build up the objects and definitions used to define the final object.
If the programmer references an object outside the local definition (distinguishable by the gray overlay that fades those objects), that object will automatically become a reference for the local definition and appear as an $\mathsf{initial}$ inside the local definition.

\section{Definition, Not Manipulation}
\label{sec:not-manip}

It is important to understand that while the Construct programming environment apppears in many ways similar to a vector graphics editor, it does not operate by direct manipulation of objects.
The nature of the objects in the program space is given by definition rules which establish relationships between the objects. 
Actually dragging or otherwise transforming the particular objects shown in the program space, while potentially supported for clarification purposes, will have no effect on the meaning of a Construct program.

The program space is presented to the programmer to provide an example of the data in the program at runtime, lifting the burden of mental simulation of the effects of the code. 
Construct is therefore not a programming by example\footnote{cite DCS Pygmalion} system, but rather {\it programming with examples}\footnote{Brad: where does this originate?}.


\chapter{The Structure of Programs}
\label{chap:struct}

A program in Construct is a Definition (see Section~\ref{sec:def}) which follows a well-defined procedure to generate {\it final} objects from {\it initial} objects. 
Since a program is a Definition, it can used in other programs to asbtract away higher-level operations used for generating more complex objects.

A program is a tuple:

$$(O, D)$$

$O$ is the set of all objects (see Section \ref{sec:obj}) that are present in the program. 
$D$ is a function $\rho \to \{\delta_1, \delta_2, \dots\}$ which, given an object $\rho$, produces the set of all definitions (see Section \ref{sec:def}) which describe $\rho$.

Alternatively, $O$ and $D$ may be combined to generate a directed acyclic graph $G$. 
Any valid topological sorting of $G$ is a valid ordering of runtime execution for the program.

\section{Objects}
\label{sec:obj}

An object in Construct is a named entity $\rho$ which exists in 2d space. 
Objects may have position, orientation, magnitude, or any other characteristics which are appropriate based upon their Type (see Section \ref{sec:types}). 

At any point in the execution of a Construct program, any object is a representative of the {\it valid parameter set}. 
This is a set which contains all parameter combinations which are valid based upon the Definitions (see Section \ref{sec:def}) of the object.

\section{Types}
\label{sec:types}

Objects in Construct are classified into one of several types:\\

\noindent\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l l l X}
$\tau$ & $::=$ & $\mathsf{pt}$ & A point in 2d space. \\
 & & $\mathsf{ln}$ & An infinite line in 2d space. \\
 & & $\mathsf{circ}$ & A circle in 2d space. \\
 & & $\mathsf{ang}$ & An angle in 2d space. \\
 & & $\mathsf{dist}$ & A distance in 2d space. \\
 & & $\mathsf{set}(\tau)$ & A homogenous collection of objects of type $\tau$. \\
 & & $\mathsf{grp}(\tau_1, \dots, \tau_n)$ & A ordered collection of objects.
\end{tabularx}

Additionally, some built-in Definitions (see Section \ref{sec:def}) accept numerals as parameters. 
Numerals are shown here with a bar, for example $\bar{n}$ is some integer $n$.
These numerals allow convenient specification of constant values. 
Programmer-created definitions can not accept numerals as initials. 

\section{Definitions}
\label{sec:def}

Definitions are rules that are used to describe an object based upon other objects. All of an object's definitions are evaluated at runtime, during Reconciliation (see Section~\ref{sec:reconc}). 

Each Definition is a member of a Definition Class $\delta_\tau$, which is the class of all Definitions that describe objects of type $\tau$. 
Each Definition's inputs and outputs must be a single object, though groups and sets may be passed.
A Definition may be totally described in this notation (group syntax simplified for brevity): 

$$\mathsf{defname}[\tau](\rho_1 : \tau_1; \rho_2 : \tau_2; \dots)$$

If the Definition is listed as part of a Definition Class (as below), we omit the bracketed type information for brevity. Additionally, we do not specify the type in our syntax (see Chapter \ref{chap:howto}) because it can be derived from context.

\subsection{Generic Definitions}

\noindent \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l l l X}
$\delta_{\tau}$ & $::=$ & $\mathsf{null}$ & This definition has no effect on this object. It may be used with the $\mathsf{handle}$ modifier (see Section \ref{subsec:mods-defs}). \\
 & & $\mathsf{id}(\rho : \tau)$ & This object is identical to $\rho$. \\
 & & $\mathsf{of}(s : \mathsf{set}(\mathsf{\tau}))$ & This object is identical to a member of the set $s$. This definition is added implicitly in the programming environment when the user manipulates a set member. \\
 & & $\mathsf{elem}(\bar{m}; \; g : \mathsf{group}(\tau_1, \dots, \tau_n))$ & This object is the $m$th object in the group $g$. If $m > n$ or $\tau_m \neq \tau$, raise $\mathsf{DefErr}$. This definition is added implicitly in the programming environment when the user manipulates an object inside a group.

\section{Modifiers}
\label{sec:mods}

Modifiers are higher-level constructs than Definitions which further specify program behavior.

\label{subsec:mods-obj}

$\mu_{\rho}$ & $::=$ & $\mathsf{initial}$ & $\rho$ is given as an input to the program. \\
 & & $\mathsf{final}$ & $\rho$ is the result of the program. \\

$\mu_{\delta_\tau}$ & $::=$ & $\mathsf{not}$ & The negation of this Definition. \\
 & & $\mathsf{handle}(\delta_\tau')$ & If this Definition raises a runtime error, instead apply $\delta_\tau'$. \\
 & & $\mathsf{each}$ & Applies this Definition over all members of a set, specifying a new Definition in the class $\delta_{\mathsf{set}(\tau)}$. If $\mathsf{DefErr}$ is raised at any point, this whole definition raises $\mathsf{DefErr}$. \\
 & & $\mathsf{filter}$ & Applies this Definition over all members of a set. If the definition does not raise an error, include its {\it final} object in the new set. Otherwise, skip that object without raising $\mathsf{DefErr}$. \\

$\lambda$ & $::=$ & $\mathsf{local}(G)$ & Produces a local definition from the program subgraph $G$. This can be used in conjunction with the $\mathsf{handle}$, $\mathsf{each}$ and $\mathsf{filter}$ modifiers to apply more complex behaviors.\\
\end{tabularx}


\chapter{Execution}
\label{chap:exec}

\section{Runtime Errors}
\label{sec:runtime-errors}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l l l X}
$\epsilon$ & $::=$ & $\mathsf{DefErr}$ & A set of Definitions (see Section \ref{sec:def}) could not be Reconciled (see Section \ref{sec:reconc}) to a valid object.
\end{tabularx}

\section{Reconciliation}
\label{sec:reconc}

When an object in the Evaluation DAG becomes definable (when all of its immediate prerequisites are defined), the Construct runtime begins a process of Reconciliation. 
During Reconciliation the runtime attempts to find a state for the object which satisfies all of the Definitions applied to it. 
It selects a candidate object from the set of all objects which satisfy the constraints placed upon it.

\section{Failure}
\label{sec:failure}

During runtime, it is possible for Reconciliation to fail by an object possessing conflicting definitions. 

This may initially occur as a result of choices made during the reconciliation of ancestor objects in the program. 
The runtime will first try to resolve the failure by redefining these ancestors in a way that will produce a valid result. 
If this is unsuccessful, the runtime declares $\mathsf{DefErr}$.

A runtime error is then propagated back along the chain of ancestor definitions from the definiton which triggered it. 
If the runtime encounters a definition which has a $\mathsf{handle}$ modifier attached to it, it will stop this propagation and attempt to redefine the program using the alternate definition.
This definition itself may fail, which repeats this process on the changed program graph.

If the runtime error propagates all the way to to the initial objects at the top level of the program, the program has failed. 
The user should be alerted to the failure, and if the program is being evalauated in the programming environment, specific debugging information should be made available.

\subsection{Triangle Area}

\hline
\raisebox{-.5\height}{\includegraphics{../triarea/stage4.pdf}} & {\tt ln l3.thru(p3).thru(p4) \newline

        ln l6.thru(p4).perp(l1) \newline
        pt p6.on(l5).on(l6)} & {\small The triangle (p1,p4,p6) has the same area as the original triangle.} \\
\hline
\raisebox{-.5\height}{\includegraphics{../triarea/stage6.pdf}} & {\tt final dist area.span(p4;p6)} & {\small This distance is the area because the base of the triangle is 2, so the height equals the area.}
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Adjacent Segments}
\label{subsec:adjsegs}

This program demonstrates a verification definition. Unlike other definitions which produce a resulting object, this definition just ensures that some relationships are satisfied over its inputs. Verifications may be used as part of extracting objects from sets, or as contracts in programs.

Here we use an abbreviated textual syntax for referencing objects in groups. {\tt obj[1][2]} references the second item in a group which is the first item of a group object named {\tt obj}. This notation is similar to array addressing in modern textual programming langauges. \\

\noindent \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l X p{4cm}}
\hspace{3.5cm}\vspace{1cm} & {\tt initial grp(grp(ln;circ);\newline grp(ln;circ)) segs } & {\small Start with two segments (represented by a line and a bounding circle). } \\
\hline
\vspace{0.5cm} & 
{\tt
pt adj.on(segs[1][1]) \newline
      .on(segs[1][2]) \newline
      .on(segs[2][1]) \newline
      .on(segs[2][2])
} & {\small Verify that the lines and circles all intersect at a common point.} \\
\end{tabularx}\\\\

If this simple definition fails, then we know that our line segments are not adjacent.

The next example program incorporates the previous examples and calls them as user-created definitions. We use the keyword {\tt void} to where a verification definition produces no resulting object; in the geometric interface, this is invisible to the programmer.

User-created definitions are enclosed in curly braces to distinguish them from the built-in definitions. Local definitions are also enclosed in curly braces, but not named. \\
